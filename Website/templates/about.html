				Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a type of polymorphism that involves a variation at a single nucleotide base-pair. SNPs are extensivley studied to see how they relate to disease, treatment response, and other characteristics in humans and other organisms.

				<br>
				<br>

				<h3>Inputs </h3>

				<br>

				The SNPip web application will allow users to retrieve SNP information given either a genomic coordinate (chromosome, start and end), SNP name (rs value), or gene name (or any aliases associated to it) from specific populations in the 1000 genome project. 

				<br>

				<br>

				<h3> Outputs </h3>


				<br>

				The application will return the following information for each SNP:<br><br>	
				<ul>
					<li>Name (rs value)</li>
					<li>Genomic position</li>
					<li>Genotype frequencies</li>
					<li>Allele frequency</li>
				</ul>

				<br>

				If multiple SNPs are returned, the user will be able to select the population(s) and summary
				statistics of interest, and the application will calculate them and plot their distribution in sliding 
				windows along the region. The user will also be able to download a text file with the values of summary statistics. 
				At least three summary statistics should be reported, for instance: <br><br>

				<ul>
					<li>Genetic diversity</li> 
					<li>Haplotype diversity (e.g. homozygosity)</li>
					<li>Test against neutrality (e.g. Tajimaâ€™s D)</li>
					<li>Population genetic variation (FST value) for each pair of populations</li>
				</ul>
